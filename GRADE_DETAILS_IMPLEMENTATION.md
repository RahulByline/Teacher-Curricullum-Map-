# Grade Details Implementation

## Overview
This document explains the changes made to implement grade details (learning objectives and duration) display in the curriculum grid view cards.

## Problem Analysis
The original system had a curriculum flow: **Curriculum → Grade → Book → Unit → Lesson → Stage**, but grades and books were missing learning objectives and duration fields, which were only available for units, lessons, and stages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`mysql_schema.sql`)
- **Grades table**: Added `learning_objectives JSON DEFAULT NULL` and `duration VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT ''`
- **Books table**: Added `learning_objectives JSON DEFAULT NULL` and `duration VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT ''`
- Updated sample data to include learning objectives and duration for grades and books

### 2. Database Migration Script (`fix_database_schema.sql`)
- Created migration script to add missing columns to existing databases
- Updates existing sample data with learning objectives and duration

### 3. TypeScript Type Updates (`src/types/curriculum.ts`)
- **Grade interface**: Added `learningObjectives: string[]` and `duration: string`
- **Book interface**: Added `learningObjectives: string[]` and `duration: string`

### 4. Frontend Component Updates
#### `src/components/CurriculumGridView.tsx`
- **Grade cards**: Now display learning objectives (showing first 2 with "+X more" if more exist) and duration with clock icon
- **Book cards**: Now display learning objectives (showing first 2 with "+X more" if more exist) and duration with clock icon
- Replaced "-" placeholders with actual data display

#### `src/components/ContentEditor.tsx`
- **Overview Grade Cards**: Updated the grade cards in the main overview section to display duration and learning objectives
- Added duration section with clock icon (appears first)
- Added learning objectives section with bullet points (showing first 2 with "+X more" indicator, appears below duration)
- Both sections are separated by border lines for better visual organization

### 5. Hook Updates (`src/hooks/useCurriculum.ts`)
- **addGrade function**: Now includes `learningObjectives: []` and `duration: ''` in new grade creation
- **addBook function**: Now includes `learningObjectives: []` and `duration: ''` in new book creation
- Updated initial sample data to include learning objectives and duration

### 6. API Hook Updates (`src/hooks/useCurriculumAPI.ts`)
- **addGrade function**: Now accepts optional `learningObjectives` and `duration` parameters
- **addBook function**: Now accepts optional `learningObjectives` and `duration` parameters

### 7. Backend Server (`backend/server.js`)
- Already had support for learning objectives and duration in grades and books API endpoints
- No changes needed as the backend was already prepared for these fields

## Data Flow
1. **Database**: Grades and books now store learning objectives (JSON array) and duration (string)
2. **Backend API**: Fetches and returns the new fields from database
3. **Frontend**: Displays the learning objectives and duration in the grid view cards
4. **User Interface**: Users can see grade details directly in the cards below book, unit, lesson information

## Visual Changes
- **Grade cards**: Show learning objectives as bullet points (max 2 visible) and duration with clock icon
- **Book cards**: Show learning objectives as bullet points (max 2 visible) and duration with clock icon
- **Consistent styling**: Matches the existing design pattern used for units, lessons, and stages

## Testing
1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Start the frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to the grid view
4. Create a new grade with learning objectives and duration
5. Verify the grade details are displayed in the card

## Database Migration
To update existing databases, run:
```sql
mysql -u root -p < fix_database_schema.sql
```

## Benefits
- **Complete information**: Users can now see all curriculum details at a glance
- **Consistent experience**: All levels (grade, book, unit, lesson, stage) now show learning objectives and duration
- **Better planning**: Teachers can understand the scope and timeline of each curriculum level
- **Improved UX**: No need to drill down to see basic information about grades and books

## Future Enhancements
- Add editing capabilities for grade and book learning objectives directly in the grid view
- Implement duration calculations (sum of child elements)
- Add progress tracking for learning objectives
- Include standards mapping for grades and books
